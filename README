Here's the all source to craigslittlebuddy.com. 

craigslittlebuddy.com was a simple site that allowed you
to search the classified sections of multiple craigslist locations at the same time.

The site was originally intended to help my guitar-nerd friends find good deals. A ton of folks I know
are fanatics for specific guitars and buy as many as they can find (http://tinyurl.com/mrkesd for example).
So these dudes search the instrument classifieds of a dozen or so different CL locations, multiple times a day
hoping to see if anything new's popped up. "Well, that's annoying." I thought. I knew CL had rss feeds for 
search so "why not hack together a site that hits those RSS URLs and combines the results.". That's 
why I built the site (eventually I added all the other classified sections). It's not rocket science, 
took a about day to toss together (the code is just a giant, crappy hack) but it saved my buddies a ton 
of time. All it cost me was a day and $50 for the graphics.

This site was running for quite a while and all of a sudden craigslist banned my host's IP from accessing
their search results. So figured "eh fuck it" & I gave up assuming i was hosed for good but a few weeks later 
a user emailed me saying that the site had magically started working again (they un-banned my IP). sweet!
To midigate getting banned again I dramatically decreased how often I hit craigslist for search results 
(increased cache time from 30 min to 6 hours) but was didn't cut it &eventually I got banned again.

Dealing w/ CL is a losing battle... But at the same time people were getting value from the site (I got a ton of from folks saying how much the site's decreased their "hunting" time). It sucks to leave people high and dry...

So, fuck it - here's the code: 
go ahead and run it on your home machine for your own personal use. 
if you're motivated enough to get it working then have at it.

------------- INSTALLATION & CONFIG -----------------
You need PHP & Apache running on your home machine.
For windows read: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html
For Mac: http://foundationphp.com/tutorials/php_leopard.php
For Linux: I assume you know what you're doing if you're using Linux

Google for more help ;-)

... And Don't forget to enable mod_rewrite

You need an apache virtual host to run this site. Below there's an example of an apache virtual host config
that uses name a based virtual host.

A couple notes:
I've always had this in the main apache conf. NEVER in a .htaccess file. So I can't guarantee that 
the mod_rewrite rules work in a .htaccess file

Also check out the index.php file. You'll see 2 constants there that you'll care about...

MAGPIE_CACHE_DIR: where to cache the rss that's fetched from craigslist
MAGPIE_CACHE_AGE: how long to cache the RSS.


------------- APACHE CONFIG-----------------

# might need the following NameVirtualHost line in your apache conf file if
# you don't already have named virtual hosts enabled
#
# NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>

    DocumentRoot /<the>/<path>/<on>/<your>/<machine>/<to>/craigslittlebuddy.com/www

	# you will need to enter this domain name in your hosts file
