        Me, <a href="http://www.phatduckk.com">Arin</a>.
        I'm the lead developer over at <a href="http://www.fuzz.com">Fuzz</a>. Before this I was at <a href="http://www.topix.com">Topix</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.spoke.com">Spoke Software</a> and a few other startups.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span>Why?</span>
        Honestly 'cause it was easy enough and I wanted to help people have an easier time finding used guitars &amp; basses. 
        Check out the <a href="/home/about">about page</a> for a quick story.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span>You making any money? You planning on making money?</span>
        Nope, and "no". That would be against <a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.html">craigslist's terms of use</a>.
        I gotta play nice to make sure they don't get mad at me.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <span>Is craigslist gonna get mad at you?</span>
        <del>I don't think so</del> I hope not... I send traffic their way and make no money at all. I don't see why'd they'd get pissed.

        This site's only for "for sale" stuff. Plus, apartments, real-estate and other housing stuff's local specific
